## 🎯 Passionate About Building

I love **creating products and tools that solve real problems** at scale. Whether it's developing mission-critical systems, leading engineering teams, or building open-source tools that thousands of developers use - I thrive on turning complex challenges into elegant solutions.

**My Mission**: Use technology to amplify human potential and create systems that make people's lives better, whether through innovative products or developer tools that boost productivity.

## 💼 My Engineering Journey

### 🌟 Building Teams & Products That Scale

I'm currently leading the charge to establish Snappy's first U.S. engineering presence in Austin, Texas. It's been an incredible challenge - relocating across the world to build a team from scratch, figuring out how to make distributed collaboration actually work across time zones, and becoming the technical bridge between engineering and business teams.

What gets me excited is seeing how small changes in developer experience can create massive impact. I built our Developer Experience function from the ground up, creating tools and processes that made everyone's life easier. That Compass metrics portal I launched? It completely changed how we think about engineering productivity.

### 🚀 Creating Products That Matter

One of my proudest moments was architecting Snappy's first monetized API platform. We went from zero to a full product line generating real revenue from enterprise clients. But what mattered most was the team transformation - taking a struggling group and turning them into the fastest-growing division in the company.

I love the challenge of scaling systems. Taking APIs from serving hundreds to handling enterprise-scale traffic, writing thousands of tests to ensure reliability, and establishing standards that everyone rallies around. It's not just about the code - it's about creating the foundation for sustainable growth.

### 💡 What Drives My Work

I believe in engineering as a craft that serves both technical excellence and human needs. Whether it's mentoring developers to think bigger, bridging the gap between engineering metrics and business outcomes, or creating tools that make complex systems simpler - I thrive on problems that require both technical depth and human insight.

My journey has taught me that the best solutions come from understanding people as much as understanding code. That's what keeps me passionate about building teams and products that create lasting impact.

### 🚀 Current Projects

I'm currently building [**Forge.js**](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/forge-js) - an open-source ecosystem of developer tools focused on improving code quality and team velocity. This includes ESLint plugins, CLI tools, and monorepo frameworks that help teams scale efficiently.

### 🎯 Where I Find Myself Today

I've reached a point in my career where the technical challenges excite me just as much as the human ones. Leading distributed teams across continents, building products that serve real business needs, and creating environments where engineers can do their best work - these are the aspects that keep me energized.

What matters to me most is the intersection of technology and humanity. I believe the best engineering happens when we understand that behind every system, API, and deployment, there are people who depend on that technology working reliably. My work is driven by creating solutions that are not just technically sound, but also serve human needs and enable others to do meaningful work.

I value craftsmanship in code and culture. Whether it's writing clean, testable code or fostering an environment where diverse perspectives lead to better outcomes, I find fulfillment in the details that create lasting impact. I'm at a place where I can see both the forest and the trees - understanding how individual contributions fit into larger organizational goals, and how small improvements in process can lead to significant gains in team productivity and product quality.
