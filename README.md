## 🎯 Passionate About Building

I love **creating products and tools that solve real problems** at scale. Whether it's developing mission-critical systems, leading engineering teams, or building open-source tools - I thrive on turning complex challenges into elegant solutions.

**My Mission**: Use technology to amplify human potential and create systems that make people's lives better.

## 💼 My Engineering Journey

### 🌟 Current Focus
Leading Snappy's U.S. engineering expansion in Austin, Texas. Building distributed teams across continents, architecting revenue-generating API platforms, and establishing scalable infrastructure that supports rapid growth.

### 🧭 My Leadership Philosophy
I think deeply about how engineering organizations scale. In my recent writing about engineering vision for 2025, I explored how exponential growth requires exponential thinking - understanding that technical decisions have compounding effects on team velocity and business outcomes.

What fascinates me is the interplay between incentives, ownership, and expertise. Teams should become domain experts rather than generalists, with clear north star metrics that align work with business success.

### 🎯 Where I Find Myself Today
If I would need to explain my current level of experience it would be around **IC5±** (MUI/Google equivalent):

*"You have broader influence outside of your direct team and projects. You've built strong internal partnerships and may be leading multiple projects. You likely manage several direct reports or are the primary leader for a product. Impacts also teams outside of their direct leadership by coaching other leads, collaborating with teams on bigger projects or helping them achieve their goals."*

I value craftsmanship in both code and culture. Whether it's writing clean, testable code or fostering environments where diverse perspectives lead to better outcomes - I find fulfillment in the details that create lasting impact.
