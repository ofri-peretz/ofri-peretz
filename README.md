## 🎯 Passionate About Building

I love **creating products and tools that solve real problems** at scale. Whether it's developing mission-critical systems, leading engineering teams, or building open-source tools that thousands of developers use - I thrive on turning complex challenges into elegant solutions.

**My Mission**: Use technology to amplify human potential and create systems that make people's lives better, whether through innovative products or developer tools that boost productivity.

## 💼 My Engineering Journey

### 🌟 Building Teams & Products That Scale

I'm currently leading the charge to establish Snappy's first U.S. engineering presence in Austin, Texas. It's been an incredible challenge - relocating across the world to build a team from scratch, figuring out how to make distributed collaboration actually work across time zones, and becoming the technical bridge between engineering and business teams.

What gets me excited is seeing how small changes in developer experience can create massive impact. I built our Developer Experience function from the ground up, creating tools and processes that made everyone's life easier. That Compass metrics portal I launched? It completely changed how we think about engineering productivity.

### 🚀 Creating Products That Matter

One of my proudest moments was architecting Snappy's first monetized API platform. We went from zero to a full product line generating real revenue from enterprise clients. But what mattered most was the team transformation - taking a struggling group and turning them into the fastest-growing division in the company.

I love the challenge of scaling systems. Taking APIs from serving hundreds to handling enterprise-scale traffic, writing thousands of tests to ensure reliability, and establishing standards that everyone rallies around. It's not just about the code - it's about creating the foundation for sustainable growth.

### 💡 What Drives My Work

I believe in engineering as a craft that serves both technical excellence and human needs. Whether it's mentoring developers to think bigger, bridging the gap between engineering metrics and business outcomes, or creating tools that make complex systems simpler - I thrive on problems that require both technical depth and human insight.

My journey has taught me that the best solutions come from understanding people as much as understanding code. That's what keeps me passionate about building teams and products that create lasting impact.

### 🚀 Current Projects

I'm currently building [**Forge.js**](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/forge-js) - an open-source ecosystem of developer tools focused on improving code quality and team velocity. This includes ESLint plugins, CLI tools, and monorepo frameworks that help teams scale efficiently.

### Engineering Leadership Assessment

Based on industry-standard leveling frameworks (comparable to [MUI's IC levels](https://mui-org.notion.site/Leveling-at-MUI-5c30f9bfe65149d697f346447cef9db1) or Google/Microsoft staff levels):

**Current Level**: IC5 - Senior Staff Engineer / Engineering Manager equivalent

- **Scope**: Leads distributed engineering teams across global timezones
- **Impact**: Drives product innovation, establishes scalable infrastructure, builds engineering culture
- **Technical Depth**: 10+ years building production systems at scale
- **Leadership**: Manages cross-functional initiatives, mentors teams, influences technical strategy

**Key Strengths**:

- **Product Engineering**: Architected revenue-generating API platforms and scaled systems 100x
- **Developer Experience**: Built DevEx function from scratch, established testing and tooling standards
- **Team Leadership**: Hired and mentored engineering teams, led cross-continental operations
- **Open-Source Impact**: Created tooling ecosystem used by thousands of developers

**Career Trajectory**: Progressed from individual contributor to technical leadership, now focused on scaling engineering organizations and driving product innovation.
