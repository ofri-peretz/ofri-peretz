## 🎯 Where I Find Myself Today

Leading Snappy's U.S. engineering expansion. Building distributed teams, architecting revenue-generating API platforms, and establishing scalable infrastructure.

If I would need to explain my current level of experience it would be around **IC5±**.

I value craftsmanship in both code and culture. Whether it's writing clean, testable code or fostering environments where diverse perspectives lead to better outcomes - I find fulfillment in the details that create lasting impact.
